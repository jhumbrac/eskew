I was a shy 18 year old teen who didn\u2019t like to be left alone in a room with strangers. As a matter of fact I took my mom with me. BTW mom was no longer allowed after that session Brittney took me and showed me that I have a voice and an ability to be heard. She helped teach me how to express myself. I learned how to showcase the things that I felt very passionate about. She listened to my fears and helped me learn to fight those fears. Brittney helped me organize my thoughts and use them to my best ability. It was because of her that I created a community on Facebook called #YOUmatter where we come together to talk about suicide and the prevention strategies in hopes that we can save lives. It is also because of her that I can now speak in public without using words such as \u201cum, like, and uh\u201d and replace them with words that flow. She wasn\u2019t just my coach she IS my friend. As a matter of fact when they called me out as top 5 at Teen USA I could hear her somewhere in the back of my mind saying \u201cKB I told you that you can do this\u201d. I believe in myself now and have the confidence needed to take on the world and I owe it to Brittney.

Considering a gown walk was all that was required of me, I seemed to do ok. Then I ventured out into the state level pageants. At that point I decided to try out Brittney Eskew and little did I know, she would change our world around! On our first lesson, she spent time gaining my trust and getting to know me. She was so\xa0\xa0patient\xa0\xa0and encouraging. I\u2019ve never met someone so positive in my life! Mrs. Britt has taught me that being myself is the best person I can be, to never compare myself to others, to NEVER give up, and to ALWAYS be kind no matter what! Through my journey with her, I\u2019ve consistently gained more energy and confidence on and off the stage!

During COVID, it has been hard for us to see her in person but she\u2019s so good at working remotely that it doesn\u2019t even matter!

I contacted Brittney to help my daughter prepare for the Little Miss TN Cosmos pageant with less than 3 weeks to spare. We met with her in her studio for a 2 hour \'crash session\'. In those 2 short hours, Brittney was able to choreograph an amazing evening gown, fitness, and fun fashion routine. Not only did Brinlee win the state title, she also won in all 3 categories! To prepare for nationals, I pre-booked multiple in-studio sessions in advance. Unfortunately, we entered into a world wide pandemic that forced us to do virtual sessions. I was so concerned that Brinlee wouldn\u2019t get as much from these sessions as the in-studio sessions but boy, was I wrong! Brinlee went to nationals and I have never seen her with so much confidence and poise on that stage! Brinlee now holds the title of Little Miss Cosmos United States and she would have never accomplished this without Brittney in her corner. Brittney challenges Brinlee and pushes her outside of her comfort zone all while encouraging her to remain true to herself. She has helped Brinlee build confidence in herself that she will be able to carry with her throughout her life.
